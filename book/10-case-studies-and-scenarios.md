# Case Studies and Scenarios

## Scenario 1: New Variant Introduction
- **Old Way**: Engineers manually validate BOM completeness, cross-check PLM vs. ERP, and assemble documentation across regions.
- **Agentic Way**: Variant agents validate configuration rules, BOM Consistency Agents reconcile PLM/ERP, and Documentation Agents pre-populate traceability. Release prep drops from days to hours.

## Scenario 2: Critical Component Change Across Families
- **Old Way**: Impact analysis depends on tribal knowledge and spreadsheets; missing downstream documents often surface late.
- **Agentic Way**: Change Impact Agents identify all affected BOMs, variants, documents, and tests; generate a structured ECO package. Man-hour savings: multi-product impact analysis compressed from a week to a day.

## Scenario 3: Historical BOM Cleanup
- **Old Way**: Teams manually audit BOM attributes for compliance (UDI, labeling, sterilization) and chase data owners.
- **Agentic Way**: Data Quality Agents scan for missing or invalid attributes and rank cleanup tasks by risk and usage. Teams focus effort where it matters, halving cleanup time.

## Scenario 4: Field Feedback Loop
- **Old Way**: Service data and failure patterns rarely flow back into engineering decisions without manual summaries.
- **Agentic Way**: Field event topics feed agents that correlate failures to BOM variants; recommendations trigger ECOs or service bulletins with draft content. Response cycles shorten and traceability improves.
