# Operating Model and Organizational Change

## Roles
- **UNS & Agent Platform Owner**: Maintains event backbone, schemas, and runtime standards.
- **BOM & Configuration Engineering Lead**: Owns variant rules, attribute definitions, and reconciliation policies.
- **Agent Developers and Data Modelers**: Implement agents, mappings, and tests.
- **Regulatory/Quality Liaison**: Ensures validation, documentation, and e-signature practices meet regulatory expectations.

## Collaboration Model
- Product teams request new agents or enhancements via a backlog with clear templates (data sources, desired actions, approval paths).
- EaaS integrates with engineering change boards; agent recommendations appear as structured inputs to ECR/ECO decisions.
- Feedback loops capture false positives/negatives to refine rules and thresholds.

## Change Management
- Communicate the assistant role of agents; emphasize that engineers retain final approval.
- Provide training on reviewing agent proposals, interpreting dashboards, and logging approvals.
- Start with recommendation mode, then graduate agents to auto-apply for low-risk tasks once trust and validation are established.
