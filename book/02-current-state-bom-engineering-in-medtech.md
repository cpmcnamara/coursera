# Current State of BOM Engineering in MedTech

## Typical Landscape
- **PLM** for design BOMs, revisions, and ECR/ECO workflows.
- **ERP** for manufacturing and service BOMs, material masters, and costing.
- **CPQ** for sales configurations and pricing logic.
- **PDM/CAD vaults** for CAD structures and drawings.
- **Spreadsheets and scripts** as glue for exceptions and late-stage alignment.

## Where Manual Work Dominates
- BOM roll-ups, variant explosions, and synchronization between PLM and ERP are often manual or semi-scripted.
- Impact analysis for part or specification changes requires engineers to hunt through BOMs, documents, and test methods.
- Mapping between engineering attributes and ERP material fields is hand-built and inconsistently applied across projects.

## Man-Hour Waste
- Hours per ECO spent checking which BOMs, variants, and documents are affected and whether ERP matches PLM.
- Repeated back-and-forth when PLM and ERP structures diverge, delaying releases and consuming engineering time.
- Firefighting during audits or manufacturing ramps because mismatched BOMs drive rework and urgent change orders.
