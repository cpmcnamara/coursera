# Introduction: Why Agentic Engineering for BOM Management

## The Core Problem
- Medtech products carry complex product structures, variants, and region-specific configurations that must satisfy regulatory constraints.
- Data flows across PLM↔ERP, PLM↔CPQ, PLM↔Service, and PLM↔PDM are often bespoke and brittle, forcing engineers to reconcile BOMs manually.
- Impact analysis for ECOs requires hours of checking affected BOMs, documents, test methods, and customer configurations.

## What Agentic-Driven Engineering Means
Agentic-driven engineering uses software agents that:
1. **Observe** BOMs, part attributes, changes, and configuration selections as events.
2. **Reason** about impacts using product context, variant rules, and mappings between systems.
3. **Act** by proposing changes, synchronizing data, generating documentation, or alerting humans under governance.

These agents do not replace engineers. They remove repetitive reconciliation, free up time for design decisions, and improve BOM integrity across systems of record.

## Goals
- **Reduce manual BOM reconciliation and rework** by automating comparisons and updates between PLM, ERP, and CPQ.
- **Shorten engineering change cycles** with automated impact reports and pre-built change packages.
- **Make product structures consistently correct** across systems, improving compliance and reducing scrap, rework, and field escapes.
