# Future Directions and Next Steps

## Emerging Opportunities
- **LLM-powered agents** that assist with requirements-to-BOM mapping, labeling text generation, and validation narrative drafts.
- **Field-to-Engineering loops** where service data and IoT signals feed variant decisions and preventive ECOs.
- **Knowledge graphs** underpinning the UNS to enable richer reasoning across parts, documents, risks, and regional rules.

## 90-Day Starter Checklist
1. Identify a pilot product family and map current BOM reconciliation pain points.
2. Define UNS topics for `bom.updated`, `part.revised`, and `eco.approved`; set up schema validation.
3. Build one BOM Consistency Agent and one Change Impact Agent; keep both in recommendation mode.
4. Establish logging and dashboards for event flow health and agent outcomes.
5. Document validation plans and capture test evidence for the two agents.
6. Train engineering and quality stakeholders on reviewing agent outputs and providing feedback.
7. Measure baseline metrics (hours per ECO, divergence rate) and track improvements during the pilot.
8. Prepare an intake template for new variants or integrations and socialize it with product teams.
9. Define governance for promoting agents to auto-apply for low-risk updates.
10. Publish findings and ROI from the pilot to secure investment for broader rollout.

## Next Steps After the Pilot
- Extend agent coverage to CPQ configurations and service BOMs.
- Automate documentation generation for high-volume change types.
- Integrate agent outputs with electronic signature workflows to further compress approval cycles.
