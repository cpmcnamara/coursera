# Metrics and Value Realization

## Productivity Metrics
- Average engineer hours per ECO spent on impact analysis (before vs. after agents).
- Number of manual BOM reconciliations required per quarter.
- Volume of agent-generated change packages reused without rework.

## Quality Metrics
- Count of BOM discrepancies found during audits or pre-release checks.
- Frequency of incorrect configurations reaching ERP or CPQ.
- Data quality score: percentage of required attributes complete at release.

## Speed Metrics
- Time from ECO approval to fully aligned BOMs across PLM/ERP/CPQ.
- Time to detect and resolve PLM↔ERP divergence events.

## Reuse Metrics
- Percentage of changes using standardized agent patterns vs. custom scripts.
- Number of product families onboarded to the UNS and agent catalog.

## Building an ROI Model
1. Baseline manual hours per ECO and per BOM reconciliation.
2. Multiply by ECO volume per quarter to estimate current cost.
3. Apply expected reductions (e.g., 50–70% fewer manual checks) from pilot results.
4. Include quality benefits: avoided rework, fewer audit findings, reduced scrap.
5. Present value over 12–24 months to justify further automation investment.
