# Foreword

BOM engineering in medical technology has become a bottleneck because product data is scattered across PLM, ERP, CPQ, CAD vaults, field service tools, and countless spreadsheets. Teams spend hours reconciling part revisions, aligning variant rules, and chasing tribal knowledge about which configuration applies to a region or customer. Each ECO demands manual roll-ups, duplicate data entry, and late-stage discovery of mismatches between design and manufacturing BOMs.

This book lays out an agentic-driven engineering approach that reduces manual BOM work, improves consistency across systems, and makes engineering change predictable. Instead of adding more point-to-point integrations or checklists, we rely on software agents that observe events, reason with product context, and act under clear governance. The result is fewer BOM errors, faster change cycles, and reclaimed engineering hours for real design work.
