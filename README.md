# Agentic BOM Engineering for MedTech

A pragmatic, engineering-first book on applying agentic automation to Bill of Materials (BOM) management and engineering change in medical technology organizations. The content targets R&D engineering managers, PLM/ERP architects, configuration management leads, and product engineers who need faster, safer, and more traceable BOM flows.

## How to Navigate

## How to Use This Repo

- **Onboard new engineers**: Share the relevant chapters to explain how BOMs move across PLM, ERP, CPQ, and service tools and where agents reduce manual reconciliation.
- **Sell an Engineering-as-a-Service model**: Use chapters 06 and 07 to pitch a centralized, reusable capability for BOM automation to leadership and partner teams.
- **Plan implementation**: Follow the roadmap, metrics, and validation chapters to create an actionable rollout plan aligned with regulatory needs.

Contributions and adaptations for specific product lines or regulatory contexts are welcome.
